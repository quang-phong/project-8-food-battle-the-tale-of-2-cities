## üßê What?
"Food Battle: The Tale of 2 Cities" is a simple analysis of food between 2 biggest cities in Vietnam.

## ü§∑ Why?  
The 2 biggest cities not only in Vietnam but also in Indochina Peninsular, namely Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, have always made foreign travelers and even domestic ones indecisive to select the more suitable city to visit. The S-shaped country is narrow but long, which means the distance between the two biggest cities is large. For travelers with a limited time budget, visiting one city per travelling is virtually the only option. Therefore, they will benefit from understanding the similarities and differences between the two cities.

Representing (and sharing) the viewpoints of "young food addicts" who always hunger for more and more good food on their journeys, the author will compare and contrast Ho Chi Minh City (Th√†nh ph·ªë H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh, in Vietnamese) and Hanoi (H√† N·ªôi, in Vietnamese) with regards to food-related aspects to give some hints to their decisions. As mentioned, the main target audience is travelers who desire to come to Vietnam. More importantly, this can be used by investors and business owners to expand their market in either of the 2 cities based on understanding the gaps.
